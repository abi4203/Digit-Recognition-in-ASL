# Digit-Recognition-in-ASL

This project aims to develop a system for real-time detection and recognition of numerical signs in American Sign Language (ASL) using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). ASL is a crucial mode of communication for individuals with hearing impairments, and recognizing numbers in ASL can greatly enhance accessibility in various contexts.

The CNN model has been trained on a dataset consisting of thousands of images of hand signs for numbers 0 to 9 in ASL. Through this extensive training, the model has learned to distinguish subtle variations in hand shape, position, and movement that correspond to each numerical sign.
