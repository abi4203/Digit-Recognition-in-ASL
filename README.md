# Digit-Recognition-in-ASL

## Overview
This project aims to provide a real-time solution for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) number signs. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV, the system detects and interprets ASL number signs from live video feeds or static images. The user-friendly interface, accessible on mobile devices, makes it convenient for users to communicate numerical information effortlessly.

## Features
- Real-time ASL number sign detection from live video feeds.
- ASL number sign recognition from static images.
- User-friendly interface suitable for mobile devices.
- Integration of state-of-the-art machine learning models for accurate detection.
- Seamless communication and understanding across languages and abilities.
- Valuable educational tool for learning ASL number signs.
